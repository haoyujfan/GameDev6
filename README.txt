To build the game you simply clone the repository into your local machine. From there, you have to scons both the SConstruct file in godot-cpp as well as the SConstruct file in the root folder. After running scons, you can open the godot project in the godot editor (version 4.1.1) and run the game by clicking play.

From there on you can simply click start to play the game.

To play the game, you can attack with Q (chop), W (slice), E (stab) or defend with I (dodge), O (jump), P (shield block). Kill as many opponents as possible and get through as many levels as you can!
